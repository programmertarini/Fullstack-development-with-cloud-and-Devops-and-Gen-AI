2. World Wide Web (WWW) vs Internet - Deep Theoretical Distinction
The Critical Difference
Many beginners confuse these terms, but they're fundamentally different:
Internet = The Highway System

Physical network infrastructure
Protocols for moving data (like traffic rules)
Exists independently of any specific application

World Wide Web = One Type of Traffic on the Highway

An application that runs ON TOP of the Internet
Uses HTTP/HTTPS protocols
Just one of many services using the Internet

Theoretical Foundation of the Web
Tim Berners-Lee's Original Vision (1989):

Universal Information Space: All information should be accessible through a single interface
Hypertext Structure: Documents linked to other documents
Decentralized: No central database or control point
Platform Independent: Works on any computer system

The Web's Three Pillars:
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Describes document structure and content
Enables linking between documents

2. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

Rules for how web browsers and servers communicate
Request-response model

3. URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)

Universal addressing system for web resources
Every web page has a unique address

Code Example - Understanding the Web Stack:
javascript// This simple web interaction involves multiple layers:

// 1. APPLICATION LAYER (Your JavaScript)
const response = await fetch('https://api.weather.com/v1/current?city=London');
const data = await response.json();

/* 2. HTTP LAYER (What actually gets sent)
GET /v1/current?city=London HTTP/1.1
Host: api.weather.com
Accept: application/json
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0...
*/

/* 3. INTERNET LAYER (How it travels)
- DNS resolves api.weather.com to IP address (e.g., 203.0.113.42)
- TCP connection established to port 443 (HTTPS)
- TLS encryption negotiated
- HTTP request sent as encrypted packets
- Packets routed through Internet infrastructure
*/
Other Internet Services (Not Web):
The Internet supports many services beyond the Web:
bash# Email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
- Sends messages between mail servers
- Different protocol than HTTP
- Still uses Internet infrastructure

# File Transfer (FTP, SFTP)
- Dedicated protocols for file sharing
- More efficient than HTTP for large files

# Remote Access (SSH, Telnet)
- Command-line access to remote computers
- Critical for server administration

# DNS (Domain Name System)
- Translates domain names to IP addresses
- Essential for all Internet services
Web Evolution Theory:
Web 1.0 (1990s): Static HTML pages, read-only
Web 2.0 (2000s): Interactive, user-generated content, AJAX
Web 3.0 (2010s+): Semantic web, mobile-first, APIs everywhere
javascript// Web 1.0: Static content
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Homepage</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 1, 2000</p>
  </body>
</html>

// Web 2.0: Dynamic, interactive
fetch('/api/posts')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(posts => {
    posts.forEach(post => {
      document.getElementById('content').innerHTML += 
        `<article>${post.title}</article>`;
    });
  });

// Web 3.0: Semantic, connected data
const userPreferences = await fetch('/api/user/preferences');
const personalizedContent = await fetch(`/api/content/personalized?user=${userId}`);
// AI-powered content recommendation, real-time updates, etc.
