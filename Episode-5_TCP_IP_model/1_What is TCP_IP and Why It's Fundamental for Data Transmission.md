What is TCP/IP and Why It's Fundamental for Data Transmission:
TCP/IP is the foundational communication protocol suite that powers the internet and most modern networks. It defines how data should be packaged, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received between computers across networks.
Why TCP/IP is Fundamental:
TCP/IP provides a universal language for network communication, allowing different types of computers, operating systems, and networks to communicate seamlessly. Without TCP/IP, every device manufacturer would need to create proprietary protocols, making the interconnected internet as we know it impossible.
The Four-Layer Model
TCP/IP operates on a four-layer model, where each layer has specific responsibilities:

Application Layer - Where your web applications, APIs, and services operate (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, WebSocket)
Transport Layer - Ensures reliable data delivery between applications (TCP, UDP)
Internet Layer - Handles routing and addressing across networks (IP, ICMP)
Network Access Layer - Manages physical transmission of data (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)

As a full stack developer, you primarily interact with the Application and Transport layers, but understanding the entire stack helps you debug issues, optimize performance, and make informed architectural decisions.
