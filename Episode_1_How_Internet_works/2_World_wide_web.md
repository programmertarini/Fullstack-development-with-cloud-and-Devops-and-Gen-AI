## Overview of the World Wide Web (WWW) and Its Connection to the Internet

- **Definition**: The World Wide Web is an information system where documents and resources are identified by URLs, interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.
- **Distinction**: The Web is a service that operates on the Internet's infrastructure, not the Internet itself.
- **History**: Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN to share information among researchers.
- **Core Components**: Web browsers, web servers, and web pages.
- **Hypertext**: The fundamental concept allowing documents to link to other documents, creating a "web" of information.
- **URL Structure**: Uses the format protocol://domain/path to locate resources globally.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Application protocols that define how messages are formatted and transmitted across the web.
- **Web Evolution**: Progressed from static Web 1.0 pages to interactive Web 2.0 applications to the emerging semantic Web 3.0.
- **Accessibility**: Made Internet resources user-friendly through graphical interfaces and simplified navigation.
- **Web vs. Internet**: The Internet provides the infrastructure while the Web provides a method for accessing and sharing information on that infrastructure.
