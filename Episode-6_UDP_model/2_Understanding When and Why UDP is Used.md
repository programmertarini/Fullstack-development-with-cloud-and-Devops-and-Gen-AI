Understanding When and Why UDP is Used
Ideal Use Cases for UDP
1. Real-Time Video/Audio Streaming
Why UDP?

Latency-sensitive: Delays are more noticeable than occasional dropped frames
Loss tolerance: Missing a few video frames is acceptable; viewers won't notice
No retransmission needed: Old data becomes irrelevant quickly

Real-Life Examples:

Video conferencing: Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams
Live streaming: Twitch, YouTube Live
Voice over IP (VoIP): WhatsApp calls, Discord voice channels

Developer Scenario:
javascript// WebRTC uses UDP for real-time video/audio
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();
// Under the hood, this uses UDP for media transmission
// because real-time communication needs speed over reliability
2. Online Gaming
Why UDP?

Low latency critical: Player actions must be transmitted instantly
High frequency updates: Sending player position 20-60 times per second
Tolerable packet loss: Missing one position update is fine; next update arrives quickly

Real-Life Examples:

First-person shooters: CS:GO, Call of Duty, Valorant
Battle royale games: Fortnite, PUBG, Apex Legends
Real-time strategy: StarCraft II, Age of Empires

Developer Scenario:
javascript// Game client sending player position via UDP socket
const dgram = require('dgram');
const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');

function sendPlayerPosition(x, y, z) {
  const message = JSON.stringify({ type: 'position', x, y, z, timestamp: Date.now() });
  client.send(message, SERVER_PORT, SERVER_IP);
  // No waiting for acknowledgment - send and forget
  // If packet is lost, next position update arrives in 16ms anyway (60 FPS)
}
3. DNS (Domain Name System)
Why UDP?

Small queries/responses: Usually fit in single packet
Speed matters: Fast DNS lookups improve user experience
Retry mechanism at application level: DNS client can retry if no response

Developer Scenario:
javascript// DNS lookup happens via UDP by default
const dns = require('dns');
dns.resolve4('example.com', (err, addresses) => {
  // This query was sent via UDP to DNS server
  // If timeout, DNS resolver automatically retries
});
4. IoT and Sensor Networks
Why UDP?

Low power consumption: No connection overhead saves battery
Simple devices: Limited processing power and memory
High volume, low importance: Many sensors sending frequent updates

Real-Life Examples:

Temperature sensors sending readings every minute
Smart home devices broadcasting status
Vehicle telemetry systems

5. Broadcasting and Multicasting
Why UDP?

One-to-many communication: TCP is one-to-one only
Network discovery: Finding devices on local network
Efficient distribution: Same packet sent to multiple recipients

Developer Scenario:
javascript// Broadcasting service discovery message
const dgram = require('dgram');
const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
socket.bind(() => {
  socket.setBroadcast(true);
  const message = Buffer.from('SERVICE_DISCOVERY');
  socket.send(message, 0, message.length, 8888, '255.255.255.255');
});
When NOT to Use UDP
❌ File transfers: Need guaranteed delivery (use TCP/HTTP)
❌ Financial transactions: Cannot afford data loss (use TCP)
❌ Email: Messages must arrive intact (use TCP/SMTP)
❌ Web browsing: Pages must load completely (use TCP/HTTP)
❌ Database operations: ACID properties require reliability (use TCP)
❌ Authentication: Security tokens must arrive (use TCP)
