Real-World Performance Scenarios
Scenario 1: Video Streaming
Network Conditions: 5% packet loss, 50ms latency
TCP Behavior:

Detects packet loss after timeout
Retransmits missing packet
Blocks subsequent packets (head-of-line blocking)
Result: Buffering, stuttering video

UDP Behavior:

Lost packet simply doesn't arrive
Subsequent packets continue arriving
Result: Momentary quality drop, but playback continues smoothly

Developer Insight:
javascript// Video streaming with UDP
// Application handles packet loss at codec level
class VideoStreamHandler {
  handlePacket(packet) {
    if (packet.sequenceNumber !== this.expectedSequence) {
      // Packet lost - skip it, don't wait
      console.log(`Skipped packet ${this.expectedSequence}`);
      this.expectedSequence = packet.sequenceNumber;
    }
    this.decodeAndRender(packet);
    this.expectedSequence++;
  }
}
Scenario 2: Gaming - Player Movement
Network Conditions: 100ms latency, 2% packet loss
Why UDP Wins:
Time: 0ms    - Player moves right (UDP sends position update)
Time: 50ms   - Packet lost in network
Time: 100ms  - Next position update sent (player moved further right)
Time: 150ms  - Server receives second update, renders player at current position
Result: Smooth gameplay, one position update lost but imperceptible
If TCP was used:
Time: 0ms    - Player moves right (TCP sends position)
Time: 50ms   - Packet lost in network
Time: 150ms  - TCP times out, retransmits first position
Time: 200ms  - First position arrives (now 200ms old)
Time: 200ms  - Second position arrives
Time: 200ms  - Third position arrives (all queued)
Result: Laggy movement, player "teleports" as old packets arrive
Scenario 3: File Download
Network Conditions: Stable connection, 1% packet loss
Why TCP Wins:

File integrity is critical (missing 1% means corrupted file)
No time sensitivity (few seconds delay acceptable)
TCP automatically handles retransmissions

Developer Insight:
javascript// With UDP, you'd need to implement reliability yourself
class UDPFileTransfer {
  // Need to implement:
  // 1. Packet sequencing
  // 2. Acknowledgment system
  // 3. Retransmission logic
  // 4. Timeout handling
  // 5. Flow control
  // ... essentially rebuilding TCP!
}

// TCP does this automatically
const https = require('https');
https.get('https://example.com/file.zip', (res) => {
  // All reliability handled by TCP
  res.pipe(fileStream);
});
Performance Overhead Breakdown
TCP Overhead:

Three-way handshake: 1.5 RTT (Round Trip Time) before data transfer
ACK for every packet or group: 50% additional packets
Header size: 20-60 bytes per packet
Congestion control calculations: CPU overhead
Send/receive buffers: Memory overhead

UDP Overhead:

No handshake: 0 RTT, immediate data transfer
No acknowledgments: 0 additional packets
Header size: 8 bytes per packet (75% smaller)
No state management: Minimal CPU
No buffers needed: Minimal memory

Practical Example:
Sending 1000 bytes of data:

TCP:
- Handshake: 3 packets (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Data packet: 1000 bytes + 20 byte header
- ACK response: 40 byte packet
Total: 5 packets, ~1060 bytes + handshake overhead

UDP:
- Data packet: 1000 bytes + 8 byte header
Total: 1 packet, 1008 bytes
