Summary: Quick Decision Guide for Full-Stack Developers
Use UDP When:
✅ Real-time performance is critical (gaming, video calls)
✅ Occasional data loss is acceptable
✅ Low latency is more important than reliability
✅ Broadcasting/multicasting is needed
✅ High-frequency updates (position, telemetry, metrics)
✅ Simple request-response (DNS queries)
✅ Building on protocols that add reliability (QUIC, WebRTC)
Use TCP When:
✅ Data integrity is critical (file transfers, transactions)
✅ Order of delivery matters
✅ Reliability is more important than speed
✅ Binary completion required (either all data or none)
✅ Implementing standard protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
✅ User experience depends on complete data
Key Takeaways for Developers:

UDP is not unreliable by design; it's minimal by design - Reliability is your responsibility
Most applications use TCP - UDP is for specific use cases
Modern protocols often combine both - QUIC uses UDP with added reliability
Always implement application-level checks - Don't assume packets arrive
Security matters - UDP is more vulnerable to attacks without proper handling
Test under real network conditions - Packet loss, latency, and jitter affect behavior
Monitor and measure - Track packet loss rates and adjust accordingly
