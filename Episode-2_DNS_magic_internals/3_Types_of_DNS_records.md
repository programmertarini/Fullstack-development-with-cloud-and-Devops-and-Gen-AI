Types of DNS Records {#dns-record-types}
üìù Understanding DNS Records
DNS records are like entries in a database. Each record has a specific format and purpose. Think of them as different types of information you might store about a person in an address book.
Essential Record Types
A Record (Address Record)
Purpose: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address
Real-World Example:
www.google.com ‚Üí 172.217.14.206
When It's Used:

When someone visits your website
For any service that needs an IP address
Most common record type on the internet

Technical Details:

Points to 32-bit IPv4 address
Can have multiple A records for load balancing
TTL typically set to 300-3600 seconds

AAAA Record (IPv6 Address Record)
Purpose: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address
Why It Matters:

IPv4 addresses are running out
IPv6 provides vastly more addresses
Future-proofing your infrastructure

Example:
www.google.com ‚Üí 2607:f8b0:4004:c1b::65
CNAME Record (Canonical Name)
Purpose: Creates an alias from one domain to another
Perfect Analogy: Like a nickname that points to a real name

"Bob" ‚Üí "Robert Johnson"
"www.example.com" ‚Üí "webserver.hosting.com"

Common Use Cases:

CDN integration: assets.yoursite.com ‚Üí d123abc.cloudfront.net
Service migration: old.example.com ‚Üí new.example.com
Subdomain management: blog.example.com ‚Üí example.github.io

Important Rule: CNAME records cannot coexist with other record types at the same name
MX Record (Mail Exchange)
Purpose: Specifies mail servers for a domain
How Email Routing Works:

You send email to user@example.com
Your email server looks up MX records for example.com
Finds mail servers and their priorities
Delivers to the highest priority (lowest number) available server

Example with Priority:
example.com MX 10 mail1.example.com
example.com MX 20 mail2.example.com
example.com MX 30 backup-mail.example.com

Try mail1 first (priority 10)
If mail1 fails, try mail2 (priority 20)
If mail2 fails, try backup-mail (priority 30)

NS Record (Name Server)
Purpose: Delegates a domain to a set of DNS servers
The Delegation Process:

Like saying "For questions about this topic, ask these experts"
.com servers have NS records pointing to your domain's nameservers
Your nameservers have the actual records (A, CNAME, etc.)

Example:
example.com NS ns1.cloudflare.com
example.com NS ns2.cloudflare.com
TXT Record (Text Record)
Purpose: Stores arbitrary text data
Modern Uses (Very Important):

Email Security (SPF): Prevents email spoofing

  "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"

Domain Verification: Proves you own the domain

  "google-site-verification=abc123..."

DMARC Policy: Email authentication policy

  "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:reports@example.com"
üîß Advanced Record Types
SRV Record (Service Record)
Purpose: Defines services available on specific ports
Use Cases:

VoIP systems (SIP)
Instant messaging (XMPP)
Microsoft Active Directory
Minecraft servers

Format Explanation:
_service._protocol.domain TTL IN SRV priority weight port target
_sip._tcp.example.com 86400 IN SRV 10 60 5060 sip.example.com
PTR Record (Pointer Record)
Purpose: Reverse DNS lookup (IP to domain name)
Why It Matters:

Email servers use it to verify legitimacy
Security systems use it for logging
Network diagnostics

Example:
1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa ‚Üí mail.example.com
CAA Record (Certificate Authority Authorization)
Purpose: Specifies which certificate authorities can issue SSL certificates
Security Benefit:

Prevents unauthorized SSL certificate issuance
Protects against certificate-based attacks
